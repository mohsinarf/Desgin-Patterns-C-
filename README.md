# Design Patterns with C++
1. **Singleton Pattern**:
   - Probability: High
   - Explanation: It's a fundamental pattern used to ensure a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

2. **Factory Method Pattern**:
   - Probability: High
   - Explanation: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3. **Builder Pattern**:
   - Probability: Medium
   - Explanation: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

4. **Observer Pattern**:
   - Probability: Medium
   - Explanation: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

5. **Decorator Pattern**:
   - Probability: Medium
   - Explanation: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

6. **Adapter Pattern**:
   - Probability: Medium
   - Explanation: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper with a compatible interface.

7. **Strategy Pattern**:
   - Probability: Medium
   - Explanation: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

8. **Abstract Factory Pattern**:
   - Probability: Low to Medium
   - Explanation: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

9. **Facade Pattern**:
   - Probability: Low to Medium
   - Explanation: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

10. **Composite Pattern**:
    - Probability: Low
    - Explanation: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
